# ImageSegmentation-of-Handwritten-Digits
Image Segmentation of Handwritten Digits: build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch for the downsampling path and use a Fully Convolutional Network, FCN-8, to upsample and produce the pixel-wise label map. The model will be evaluated using the intersection over union (IOU) and Dice Score.
